## Problem Statement
This dashboard helps businesses analyze their sales and profit performance effectively. It enables stakeholders to identify top-performing products, sales trends, 
profitability patterns, discount impacts, and customer behaviors.


### Steps followed 
Step 1: Imported raw sales dataset into Power BI.

Step 2: Performed data cleaning and transformation using Power Query.

Step 3: Created calculated columns and DAX measures for metrics such as Profit Margin, Discount %, and Sales Growth.

Step 4: Built data model with relationships between Product, Customer, Sales, and Discount tables.

Step 5: Added interactive filters (slicers) for Product Category, Customer Segment, Promotion, and Date.

Step 6: Developed visuals:

          Bar/Column Charts → Top/Bottom 5 products by Sales, Profit, Quantity Sold.
          
          Line Charts → Sales and Profit trends over time (daily, monthly, quarterly, annually).
          
          Scatter Plot → Relationship between Sales & Profit.
          
          Matrix/Table → Comparative performance between two selected periods.
          
          Card Visuals → KPIs (Total Sales, Profit, Quantity Sold, Avg. Discount).

Step 7: Published dashboard to Power BI Service for stakeholder access.

# Insights

From the dashboard, the following insights can be drawn:

# . Top/Bottom Analysis

Top 5 products contribute significantly to overall sales and profit.

Certain low-performing products result in minimal revenue but higher discounts, impacting profitability.

# . Sales Trends

Monthly/Quarterly patterns reveal peak sales seasons.

Growth trends indicate strong Q2 and Q4 performance.

# .Profitability

Clear positive correlation between Sales and Profit, except for categories with heavy discounts.

# . Period Comparison

Comparing two time periods (e.g., Q1 vs Q2) shows revenue growth but declining profit margins due to higher discounts.

# . Discount Impact

Average discount by category indicates over-discounting in some segments, reducing profit margins.
